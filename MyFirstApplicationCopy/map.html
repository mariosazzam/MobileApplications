(CNN) -- Dagestan has hit the headlines, but this obscure, impoverished southern Russian republic on the coast of the Caspian Sea won't be familiar even to those who pride themselves on being news nerds.

Were it not for the fact that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two brothers implicated in the deadly Boston Marathon bombing, lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and had Tamerlan, the elder sibling, not visited there last year, most Americans would have been blissfully ignorant about this patch of the planet.
